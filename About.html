	<h2>Hello</h2> I'm Jessica and this is my portfolio website.  Its purpose is to serve as a showcase for my background and accomplishments throughout the four years I spent at Saint Joseph's University. It is a collaboration of hardwork that I have done for various courses and internships, both by myself and with a group.
	<p>I'm currenlty a senior, majoring in Communications & Digital Media, and minoring in Advertising & Promotions.  As a graduating senior, I'm hopeing to foster my career path and obtain a job that I love and enjoy.</p>
	<p>My passions include food justice, finess, and traveling.  After spending a semester studying in Florence, I'd love the opportunity to return to Europe to work in communications and public relations.</p>
